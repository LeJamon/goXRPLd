# TxQ Conformance Session

## Status
- Started: 22 failing TxQ conformance tests
- Previous: 18 failing (4 fixed: straightfoward_positive_case, replace_last_tx, replace_middle_tx, last_ledger_sequence)
- Current: 16 failing (6 fixed total: +queue_sequence, +queue_ticket)
- 22 passing (up from 16)

## Fixes Applied

### 1. maxSize initialization (txq/txq.go)
Changed `maxSize` from `uint32` to `*uint32`. Starts as nil (no limit) matching rippled's `std::optional<size_t> maxSize_` which starts as `nullopt`. Queue has no capacity limit until first `processClosedLedger()` call.

### 2. tryClearAccountQueue (txq/apply.go)
Implemented rippled's `tryClearAccountQueueUpThruTx` (TxQ.cpp:518-614). When a high-fee transaction is submitted for an account with queued transactions, it checks whether the total fee paid across all queued + new transactions can cover the escalated series fee. If so, it applies all queued transactions and the new one atomically. This fixes the `terQUEUED` vs `tesSUCCESS` pattern for queue-clearing transactions.

### 3. Time-leap close support (testing/env_submission.go, conformance/runner.go)
Added `CloseWithTimeLeap()` method that calls `ProcessClosedLedger(ctx, true)` instead of `false`. Time-leap closes reset TxQ fee metrics (`txnsExpected`) back toward the minimum, matching rippled's `env.close(env.now() + 5s, 10000ms)`. Added `txqTimeLeapLookup` map to identify which fixture steps need time-leap closes.

### 4. Actual fee level tracking (testing/env_submission.go, testing/env.go)
Added `closingFeeLevels` to track actual fee levels of applied transactions instead of assuming all transactions pay BaseLevel (256). This correctly computes the escalation multiplier (median fee) in `ProcessClosedLedger`, making fee escalation match rippled when high-fee transactions are in the ledger.

### 5. initFee config support (conformance/runner.go, testing/env.go)
Added `txqInitFeeLookup` map and `SetBaseFee`/`SetReserves` methods. Fixtures that use rippled's `initFee()` pattern (255 close steps followed by fee vote) need post-initFee reserves applied. The runner detects the initFee pattern and applies the correct reserves (e.g., base=10, reserve=200, increment=50 drops).

### 6. Relevant transaction count for blocker detection (txq/apply.go, txq/candidate.go)
Rippled computes `acctTxCount` using `lower_bound(acctSeqProx)` to skip stale transactions in the account queue (seqProxy < account's current sequence). goXRPL was counting ALL transactions. Added `RelevantCount()` and `FirstRelevant()` methods to `AccountQueue` and updated all blocker detection, sequence validation, and in-flight balance checks to use only relevant transactions.

### 7. Front-of-queue sequence validation (txq/apply.go)
When a sequence-based transaction goes at the FRONT of the account queue (before all existing entries), rippled returns `terPRE_SEQ` for future sequences. When it goes AFTER existing entries and doesn't match `nextQueuableSeq`, it returns `telCAN_NOT_QUEUE`. goXRPL was returning `telCAN_NOT_QUEUE` in both cases. Added `goesAtFront` detection using `GetPrevTx()` to match rippled's behavior. This fixed queue_ticket.

### 8. localTxs retry mechanism (testing/env_submission.go)
Rippled's `localTxs` mechanism retries ALL locally-submitted transactions at the next ledger close, regardless of result code (including tel codes like `telCAN_NOT_QUEUE_FULL`). goXRPL was only holding `terQUEUED` and retryable (`ter`) results. Extended the held transaction mechanism to also hold `tel` results, and added `retryAllHeldViaTxQ()` which is called after queue drain during Close() to resubmit held transactions through the TxQ. This fixed queue_sequence and contributed to fixing queue_ticket.

## Remaining Failing Tests (16)

### TxQMetaInfo (9 fail)
1. Sequence_in_queue_and_open_ledger — direct open ledger modify (bypasses TxQ)
2. Ticket_in_queue_and_open_ledger — similar direct modify pattern
3. Zero_reference_fee — zero baseFee edge case
4. clear_queue_failure_(load) — depends on replace_middle_tx chain
5. expiration_replacement — expiration-based gap handling
6. full_queue_gap_handling — gap filling logic
7. scaling — metric computation during scaling
8. Queue_full_drop_penalty — drop penalty during queue management
9. Re-execute_preflight — preflight re-execution during queue processing

### TxQPosNegFlows (7 fail, was 9)
1. zero_transaction_fee — fee=0 blocker can't be drained (feeLevel=0 < baseLevel)
2. unexpected_balance_change — in-flight balance/preclaim differences
3. multi_tx_per_account — balance/blocker edge cases (many steps)
4. blockers_sequence — blocker staying in queue after drain, localTxs gaps
5. blockers_ticket — blocker detection with tickets
6. In-flight_balance_checks — telCAN_NOT_QUEUE_BALANCE vs terINSUF_FEE_B (2 errors)
7. ~~queue_sequence~~ — FIXED (localTxs retry)
8. ~~queue_ticket~~ — FIXED (front-of-queue sequence validation)

## Remaining Root Causes

### Direct open ledger modify (2 tests: Sequence_in_queue_and_open_ledger, Ticket_in_queue_and_open_ledger)
Some rippled tests use `env.app().openLedger().modify()` to apply transactions directly to the open ledger, bypassing the TxQ entirely. The fixture recorder captures these as normal tx steps with tesSUCCESS. The goXRPL runner routes them through TxQ, causing terQUEUED instead of tesSUCCESS.

### Blocker detection differences (PARTIALLY FIXED)
The blocker check now uses RelevantCount (seqProxy >= acctSeqProx), matching rippled's lower_bound behavior. Remaining blocker issues (blockers_sequence, blockers_ticket, zero_transaction_fee) are caused by fee=0 blocker transactions that can't be drained from the queue during accept() because feeLevel=0 < baseLevel=256. In rippled, these appear to be drained through the localTxs replay mechanism or through the open-ledger transaction re-application path in OpenLedger::accept().

### Fee=0 blocker drain (3 tests: zero_transaction_fee, blockers_sequence, blockers_ticket)
Transactions with fee=0 have feeLevel=0 < baseLevel(256). During TxQ::accept() drain, these can't meet the fee requirement. In rippled, the open-ledger re-application path (OpenLedger.cpp:96-112) re-applies the previous open ledger's transactions to the new open ledger, which accounts for these fee=0 transactions being in the view. goXRPL doesn't replicate this step.

### In-flight balance check ordering (2 tests: In-flight_balance_checks, unexpected_balance_change)
In rippled, the in-flight balance check (telCAN_NOT_QUEUE_BALANCE) is followed by a preclaim check on a modified test view (with deducted balance). When the modified balance is too low for the fee, preclaim returns terINSUF_FEE_B. goXRPL's balance check catches the same condition earlier with telCAN_NOT_QUEUE_BALANCE, before preclaim can run.

### Preclaim in TxQ multiTxn path (not implemented)
Rippled creates a `MultiTxn` object with a modified ApplyView that adjusts the account balance and sequence for preclaim. This allows preclaim to run with simulated post-queue state. goXRPL skips this preclaim step entirely — it only checks the simple balance/reserve threshold.

### localTxs retry limitations
The held-txn retry mechanism now includes tel results and retries at close time. However, some edge cases remain where rippled's localTxs retry differs from goXRPL's implementation. The primary gap is that rippled's OpenLedger::accept() re-applies the current open view's transactions to the new view (step b), which goXRPL doesn't replicate for TxQ-routed submissions.
